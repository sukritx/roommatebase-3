## Project Summary
This is a roommate-matching and room-rental web app where users can find rooms, apply as tenants, or form and join roommate groups (parties). It is designed for exchange students, professionals, and anyone looking for shared accommodation.

Key Features
1. Easy Signup and User Profiles
Signup requires only email and password.
Users complete their profile later when they:
List a room (Room Owners).
Create a party (Room Seekers).
Profiles include name, age, gender, bio, location, budget, Instagram handle, and lifestyle preferences such as smoking and pets.
2. Room Listings and Rental Features
Room Owners Can:

List multiple rooms for rent.
Set details like price, lease term, deposit, amenities, and house rules.
Allow single-tenant or multi-tenant occupancy.
Approve or reject applicants before marking a room as taken.
Room Seekers Can:

Search for available rooms based on location, budget, and lease term.
Apply for single-tenant rooms (the owner selects a tenant manually).
Join multi-tenant rooms by creating or joining a party.
Room Availability Status:

Available – Open for applications.
Pending – Owner reviewing applicants.
Taken – No longer available.
3. Party System for Multi-Tenant Rooms
Users can form or join a party when applying for a multi-tenant room.
A user can create a party and describe their roommate preferences.
Other users can join the party if they find it suitable.
Multiple parties can apply for a room, and the room owner selects the final group.
4. Smart Room Search and Location Filtering
Users can search for rooms by:

City name (e.g., "Oslo").
Budget and lease term.
Amenities (WiFi, gym, parking, etc.).
Lifestyle preferences (No pets, No smoking, etc.).
Find Rooms Near a University:

Rooms have geolocation coordinates (latitude and longitude).
Users can search for rooms within a specific distance from their university.
Example: "Find rooms within 5 km of the University of Oslo."
Final Summary
This platform combines roommate matching with rental listings, allowing users to find suitable rooms, apply as tenants, or form and join roommate groups. Room owners maintain control over the selection process, and smart search features help users find rooms based on location, budget, and lifestyle preferences.
